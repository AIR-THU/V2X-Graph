## Introduction
This is the project repository for V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj.
V2X-Graph is the first interpretable and end-to-end learning framework for cooperative motion forecasting. It is a **SOTA method** on [V2X-Seq](https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq).
V2X-Traj is the first real-world vehicle-to-everything (V2X) motion forecasting dataset.
The code and data will be released once the paper is accepted.
